1)Create 3 tables named students,department,year


mysql> use gen_ai
Database changed
mysql> CREATE TABLE department (
    ->     department_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    ->     department_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.06 sec)

mysql> CREATE TABLE year (
    ->     year_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    ->     year_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

mysql> CREATE TABLE students (
    ->     student_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    ->     student_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    ->     department_id INT,
    ->     year_id INT,
    ->     FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES department(department_id),
    ->     FOREIGN KEY (year_id) REFERENCES year(year_id)
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.08 sec)


4)store 5 students for each department

+--------------+------------------------+

5)write a query to display students from CSE department

mysql> SELECT s.student_name, d.department_name
    -> FROM students s
    -> INNER JOIN department d ON s.department_id = d.department_id
    -> WHERE d.department_name = 'Computer Science';
+--------------+------------------+
| student_name | department_name  |
+--------------+------------------+
| Alice        | Computer Science |

| Peggy        | Computer Science |
+--------------+------------------+
6 rows in set (0.05 sec)   

6)write a query to display only deptname using student table

mysql> SELECT DISTINCT d.department_name
    -> FROM students s
    -> INNER JOIN department d ON s.department_id = d.department_id;
+------------------------+
| department_name        |
+------------------------+
| Computer Science       |
| Mechanical Engineering |
| Electrical Engineering |
| Civil Engineering      |
+------------------------+
4 rows in set (0.02 sec)

7)write a query to display students sorted by dept and firstname


mysql> SELECT s.student_name, d.department_name
    -> FROM students s
    -> INNER JOIN department d ON s.department_id = d.department_id
    -> ORDER BY d.department_name, s.student_name;
+--------------+------------------------+
| student_name | department_name        |
+--------------+------------------------+
